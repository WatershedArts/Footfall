## Configuration

Configuring Footfall is a labour intensive task. Hopefully this guide will make it a little bit easier.

### Positioning Footfall

Positioning Footfall is important. Ideally you would deploy it where there are only two directions of entry. For example, over a doorway or above a corridor. You do not want people to cut in from the side of camera. See the example footage given with this app.

### First Steps

**I would recommend placing your camera above the capture area and recording a minute long video of people passing through.** 

``raspivid -w 320 -h 240 -fps 25 -t 60000 -o testRecording.h264``

You'll need to convert the video.

``ffmpeg -i testRecording.h264 -c copy output.mp4``

On your desktop compile the footfall app. [Inside CameraManager.h](https://github.com/WatershedArts/Footfall/blob/master/Footfall/src/CameraManager.h#L10-L12) comment USE_PI_CAM out and uncomment USE_VIDEO.
This will remove the ofxCvPiCam addon from the build settings. 

Place the converted video into the data directory of the app. Add the videos string [inside CameraManager.cpp](https://github.com/WatershedArts/Footfall/blob/master/Footfall/src/CameraManager.cpp#L47).

The build and run. Alter the settings until you get the desired actions.

You'll then be able to copy the config file to the RPiVersion.

### Config File

Here are the config options you can alter.

**App Config**

| Variable Name | Description |
|---|---|
| "usehttp" | Enables the app to POST data to a server. |
| "usecsvlogging" | Enables Csv Recording.  |

**Camera Config**

| "cameraheight"| Height of the Camera. | 120 |
| "fliphorizontally"| Flip the Camera View Horizontally. | false |
| "flipvertically"| Flip the Camera View Vertically. | false |
| "trackshadows"| Decides whether the MOG2 Background Subtractor finds and keeps shadows. | false |
| "shadowpixelratio" | Sets fTau ratio, i.e how much darker the pixels need to be to be considered a shadow. | 0.5 |
| "mogthreshold"| The MOG's threshold. | 16 |
| "threshold"| Threshold value for the processed Mog image. | 175 |
| "dilate" | Dilate the image.  | 5 (should not be more the 10) |
| "erode" | Erode the image.  | 3 (should not be more the 10) |
| "history"| How many frames the MOG uses for its model. | 200 |
| "blur"| Blur Value. | 5 |
| "usemask"| Flag to tell the app to use a mask on the camera image. This is useful for light sources and other unwanted items in the cameras view. | true |
| "showshadowimage"| Flag to render the unprocessed MOG image| true |
| "MaskArea"| Series of coordinates that make a mask. | See Below |

Example Coordinates

<pre>{"coordx":10,"coordy":10},
{"coordx":150,"coordy":10},
{"coordx":150,"coordy":110},
{"coordx":10,"coordy":110}
</pre>

**Tracking Config**

|"startposx"| The starting x position of the evaluation box | 0 |
|"startposy"| The starting y position of the evaluation box | Generically, its best to be half of the Camera's Height |
|"offset"| How big the evalutation box is in pixels | 40 |
|"blobdyingtime"| The amount of time the blob takes to be deleted | 0.5 |
|"persistance"| *Determines how many frames an object can last without being seen until the tracker forgets about it. | 1 |
